{"prompt": "How does a Public Housing Authority determine rent for a Housing Choice Voucher tenant?", "response": "A PHA calculates rent by determining the payment standard for the unit size, subtracting the tenant\u2019s total tenant payment (usually based on 30% of adjusted monthly income), and paying the difference directly to the landlord as a housing assistance payment (HAP)."}
{"prompt": "What is SEMAP and how does it affect PHA oversight?", "response": "SEMAP, the Section Eight Management Assessment Program, evaluates a PHA\u2019s performance in administering the HCV program. It uses 14 indicators to score areas such as rent reasonableness, HQS inspections, and lease-up rates. Scores affect HUD\u2019s oversight level and technical assistance requirements."}
{"prompt": "Can a tenant port their voucher to another city?", "response": "Yes, under portability rules, a voucher holder can move to another jurisdiction if the receiving PHA administers the HCV program. The process includes notifying the initial PHA, coordinating with the receiving PHA, and meeting eligibility or procedural requirements outlined in HUD regulations."}
{"prompt": "How do PHAs set utility allowances?", "response": "PHAs establish utility allowances based on a schedule that reflects typical utility costs by unit size and fuel type in their jurisdiction. These allowances are deducted from the tenant\u2019s portion of rent to ensure affordability, and must be reviewed annually and updated as needed."}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between PBV and PBRA under RAD?", "response": "PBV (Project-Based Vouchers) and PBRA (Project-Based Rental Assistance) are two subsidy forms under RAD. PBVs are administered by PHAs under Section 8, while PBRA is administered by HUD. Both preserve affordability, but differ in contract terms, rent caps, and administrative procedures."}
