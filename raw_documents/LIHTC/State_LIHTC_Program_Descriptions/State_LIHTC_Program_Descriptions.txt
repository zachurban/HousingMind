The state recapture amount is equal to the proportion of the state tax credit claimed by the taxpayer that equals the proportion the federal recapture amount bears to the original federal housing tax credit amount subject to recapture.

Other	The total amount of the tax credit allowed by this section for a taxable year may not exceed the taxpayer's income tax liability. Any unused tax credit may be carried forward to apply to the taxpayer's next five succeeding years' tax liability. The taxpayer may not apply the credit against any prior tax years' tax liability.

Related Statutes and Documents	Utah Code  Section 59-7-607, 2023 QAP
Application	If applying for Housing Credits, Private Activity Bond volume cap or Olene Walker Housing Loan funds with Housing Credits, the Consolidated Application in Excel format must be used. To obtain an Excel Consolidated Application, call David Seely at (801) 902-8246 or email: Dseely@uthc.org  
Application Process	
1. Projects that wish to use Pool I state credit to reduce rents are required to first complete their application without reliance on state credits. Applicants will then complete the state credit section to reduce rents. In effort to encourage the creation of units at or below 30% of area median income, UHC will award an additional amount of state credits to those projects which reduce rents on up to 10 units to 30% area median income or below. The additional amount of state credit will be up to 20% more than the amount of credit necessary to achieve the rent reduction on a one-to-one basis of debt reduction. Example: The application spreadsheet determines that a project requires $100,000 of state credits in order to achieve rent reductions on 10 units. Ten of these units will be reduced to 30% of area median income (not including the five homeless units for which points were awarded). UHC will calculate the amount of credit necessary to reduce rents on those 10 to 30% of area median income. The project will be eligible for an award of state credit in that amount, plus a boost of 20%, in addition to the state Credit required to reduce rents in other rent tiers.

2.Projects that will be financed with tax-exempt bond and 4% (noncompetitive) LIHTCs may request state credits in a credit equivalent amount of up to $500,000 for gap funding. The applicant must commit a match of deferred developer fee. These credits will be drawn from Pool I.

3. In the event the set-aside of Pool I state credits has been exhausted, UHC may, at its sole discretion, allocate state credits from Pool II to fully fund Pool I requests.

4. State credits requested subsequently to fund financing shortfalls must demonstrate a dollar-for-dollar leveraging (including developer fees) of the proceeds of state credits with additional financial resources with finance terms at or below the applicable federal rates (AFR) published by the IRS. These credits will be drawn from Pool I.

5. The applicant must demonstrate that other local, state, federal or private resources (including deferral of fees or equity contributions by the developer) have been approached and report the results of such efforts when applying for state credits.

6. State credits are not to be used to fund increases in developer or any related party fees.

7. No project may receive an allocation of more than 25% of the balance of Pool I credits available Jan. 1.

Application Deadline(s)	
Application fee due with application,
reservations notification comes approximately 90 days from application deadline.
Allocation Process/Priorities	
State Credit Pool I: UHC has set aside about 37% of its annual state credits ceiling amount for allocation to projects that combine federal and state credits. State Credit Pool II: UHC has set aside about 63% of its annual state credits ceiling amount for allocation to permanent supportive housing (PSH) projects only. No project may receive an allocation of more than 25 percent of the State Credit Pool II.

State Credit Pool II: UHC has set aside about 63% of its annual state credits ceiling amount for allocation to permanent supportive housing (PSH) projects only. No project may receive an allocation of more than 25% of the state credit Pool II.

How To Claim the Credit	UHC will issue IRS Forms 8609 reporting the amount of credits allocated to a development following receipt of the final cost certification package in accordance with the QAP.
